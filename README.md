Artistic Licence Fair

Description: An online portfolio of the songs I have written, with the intention of using it as a way of displaying my work to prospective singers.

The songs will be collated in a series of 'Lyric Albums'.

Thereafter, I have also made spaces for a few of the other projects I would like to start - a podcast, my poetry ('The Fatigues of Ambition'), and a space for where I can upload 'Renditions' of songs written by me and sung by others.
